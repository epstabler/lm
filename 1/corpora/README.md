# 1 Supplemental: Building some IPA corpora

To create IPA corpora for one of the languages

```
   cmn eng fra hin pol rus spa tha
```

use

```
python BUILD-CORPORA <language>
```

after installing nltk corpora, UD corpora, piconll, and epitran,
as described below.

For each corpus *, several formats are saved:

* `*-words.txt` has 1 sentence per line, removing punctuation except possessive 's

* `*-ipa.txt` has ipa transcriptions of the same lines

* `*-ipaSpaced.txt` puts spaces between the ipa characters


## 1.1. Jane Austen's *Emma*

The [Gutenberg version of Emma](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/158)
is available as part of the [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) 
[corpora](https://www.nltk.org/howto/corpus.html).

NLTK also parses Emma into sentences for us.

```
pip install nltk
python -m nltk.downloader gutenberg
```

## 1.2 UD corpora
Sentences are collected from Version 2.12 of the
[Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) corpora,
available [here](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-5150).

Unpack ud-treebanks-v2.12.tgz in this directory:

```
wget https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11234/1-5150/ud-treebanks-v2.12.tgz
tar xvzf ud-treebanks-v2.12.tgz
rm ud-treebanks-v2.12.tgz
```

Probably, more recent versions of the UD treebanks will work just as well.

We use the python package piconll to access the treebank files.

```
pip install piconll
```

## 1.3 IPA transcription
[Epitran](https://github.com/dmort27/epitran), presented by
[Mortensen, Dalmia & Littell (2018)](https://aclanthology.org/L18-1429/),
was used to obtain IPA transcriptions.

Installation instructions are provided on the 
[epitran](https://github.com/dmort27/epitran) website, including
the instructions about getting Flite for English transcriptions, and
getting the Chinese dictionary.

Of course, ongoing research aims to improve the accuracy of epitran-like
tools and to extend them to more languages. See e.g.
